    <h2>Welcome</h2>

    <p>
        Technology has rewritten the story of the United States. Over a few decades, computers evolved 
        from massive machines found only in government labs to everyday tools that shape how people 
        learn, work, communicate, and live. This website explores how computers sparked a revolution, 
        how people and institutions reacted, and how major reforms developed to guide technology’s growth.
    </p>

    <p>
        This project uses verified primary and secondary sources to show how innovations like ARPANET, 
        personal computers, the World Wide Web, smartphones, and cybersecurity laws transformed American society. 
        Through historical examples, interviews, government documents, and technology archives, this website 
        explains how the digital revolution fits the National History Day 2026 theme: 
        <strong>Revolution, Reaction, Reform</strong>.
    </p>

    <h2>The NHD Theme</h2>

    <p>
        Computers sparked a revolution by changing communication, business, education, and government. 
        People and institutions reacted with excitement, fear, and confusion as technology changed rapidly. 
        Eventually, the government passed reforms such as the Computer Security Act and the Telecommunications Act 
        to manage new challenges and opportunities. This website examines all three stages in detail.
